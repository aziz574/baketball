                    <p>Kuai Deng is the best South Australian basketball prospect you haven't heard about. The 6’10 star
                        dominates games with a relentless motor and competitive spirit, and will be keen to make a name
                        for himself at LeBron James’ old alma mater The Patrick School across the 24-25 season.
